# Assignment description

The assignment is to build an ATM.

**The ATM should operate under the given rules:**

● The bills used for withdrawal is removed from the ATM

● The ATM should always return the smallest amount of bills possible

○ For example, a withdrawal of 500 should return 1 x 500 bill rather than 5 x 100 bills if possible

● The ATM can't give out more money than it contains

● The ATM can't give out amounts that the remaining bills don’t add up to

## The assignment

The ATM starts with a predetermined amount of each bill:

● 2 x 1000

● 3 x 500

● 5 x 100

Seven withdrawals will be made in the specified order. Note that based on the rules listed earlier some of the withdrawals should be declined by the ATM:

1. **1500**
2. **700**
3. **400**
4. **1100**
5. **1000**
6. **700**
7. **300**

When all of these withdrawals are completed the ATM is expected to be completely empty of bills and will not have given out more money than it contained at the start.
